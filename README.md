"# MineSweeper"

First real solo project.
The goal is to apply everything I have learned so far.
Trying to create a Minesweeper game from scratch.
Ultimately packaging it for distribution.

The first 'sprint' so to speak is finished resulting in an MVP.
The product can still use some enhancements, but most of them would involve reusing techniques I have already used before.
I do not consider this a priority at this time, because my goal is to master new techniques. 
I will keep collecting stories for the backlog untill they consitute enough work for a new sprint.
In the mean time I will work on new projects.
